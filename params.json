  "body": "## Purpose\r\n\r\nWhen I went to school, we used to spend breaks standing in front of a map, trying to find places\r\nwe've never been to. Since then, I guess I kind of like blind maps. They're great help for studying\r\nand they're fun as well.\r\n\r\nThat's why I made this simple project.\r\n\r\n## Try it yourself\r\nRight now you can test your knowledge of the following parts of the world:\r\n\r\n| Name   | Guess by name URL [1]                               | Guess by feature URL [2]                    | Datasource                                       |\r\n|--------|-------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|\r\n| CONUS  | https://www.zimmi.cz/blind-maps/usa/?inverse    | https://www.zimmi.cz/blind-maps/usa/    | [Natural Earth](http://www.naturalearthdata.com) |\r\n| Europe | https://www.zimmi.cz/blind-maps/europe/?inverse | https://www.zimmi.cz/blind-maps/europe/ | [Natural Earth](http://www.naturalearthdata.com) |\r\n| World capitals | https://www.zimmi.cz/blind-maps/world-capitals/?inverse | https://www.zimmi.cz/blind-maps/world-capitals/ | [Natural Earth](http://www.naturalearthdata.com) |\r\n\r\n[1] Given a name, you try to find the right feature in the map\r\n\r\n[2] Given a feature (highlighted in the map), you try to fill in the right name\r\n\r\n## Use it\r\nFeel free to use this little game whenever and wherever you feel it might be useful: at school, at home, giving a speech, whatever.\r\n\r\n## How to contribute\r\n\r\n1. Fork the repo.\r\n2. Run `yarn`.\r\n3. Checkout the `gh-pages` branch.\r\n4. I recommend copying `usa` folder to the new folder (name it after the piece of the world it represents)\r\n5. In that folder, replace the `data/data.js` file with your own **GeoJSON** EPSG:4326 file. Please consider simplifying the geometries, so the file is not bloated. Don't forget to prepend `let data =` before the GeoJSON itself.\r\n6. You'll find a config file at `js/config.js`. If you provide GeoJSON with `name` attribute (case-sensitive), no actions need to be taken. However, you can provide more than one attribute to check answers against in an array.\r\n7. Check that everything works fine.\r\n8. Update README.md.\r\n9. Send PR.\r\n10. Profit!\r\n",
